                <h1> About the Breed </h1>
                <p> A French Bulldog is the kind of friend who is always ready to hang out. A casual walk? Great! A lazy afternoon with the Netflix set to autoplay? Fantastic! They’re up for whatever you want to do, as long as it doesn’t involve running—they’ll happily stay put on the couch and convince you to do the same. But when you are out on the town, be prepared to be the center of attention—it’s inevitable with a French Bulldog in tow. Who doesn’t love those adorable bat ears and that lovable, smooshy face?</p>
